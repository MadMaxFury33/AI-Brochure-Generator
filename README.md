# 🧠 AI Brochure Generator

## 📘 Project Overview
The **AI Brochure Generator** is an intelligent content generation tool that automatically creates **marketing brochures** for any organization, company, or product using large language models (LLMs).  

By combining **prompt engineering**, **structured text generation**, and **automated formatting**, it produces polished, publication-ready content — perfect for company profiles, product pages, or promotional materials.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **OpenAI / Hugging Face API** (LLM-based text generation)  
- **BeautifulSoup** (web scraping)  
- **Markdown & PDF export utilities**

## 🚀 How It Works
The notebook [`brochure_generator.ipynb`](./brochure_generator.ipynb) automates the entire brochure creation process.

### Workflow:
1. **Input Prompt:** Provide your company name and description (e.g., “OpenAI – Building safe and beneficial AI”).  
2. **AI Generation:** The LLM creates structured sections (Overview, Offerings, Community, Careers, etc.).  
3. **Formatting:** Text is refined into Markdown and can be exported as `.txt`, `.md`, or `.pdf`.  
4. **Output:** A professional brochure ready for publication.
